# Deep-Facial-Expression-Analysis
In this project we will create a way to analyze different kinds of facial expressions using deep learning techniques.

In order to run these codes, you must install OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow and Keras.
Also you will have to download a 68 point face landmark predictor from Dlib. You can download this file from "http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2"
